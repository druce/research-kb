**Supporting Fact: Indexing Strategies Impact Recall and Latency**
Flat indexes are most accurate but slowest; IVF-Flat indexes are faster but sacrifice some accuracy; HNSW is popular and can be combined with Product Quantization (PQ) for better recall and memory efficiency; Vamana is optimized for on-disk performance. — The Data Quarry
