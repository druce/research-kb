**Training Adjusts Weight Parameters**
During training, the model's weight parameters are gradually adjusted to make better predictions. The training algorithm increases or decreases the language model’s weight parameters to control how information flows through the neural network. — [Timothy B. Lee and Sean Trott, Ars Technica]
