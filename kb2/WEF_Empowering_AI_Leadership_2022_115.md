**Industrial AI: Infrastructure Readiness**
Answering questions will help to determine readiness: What is the readiness of the current data, storage, compute and network infrastructure? What resources are available internally to use (or are using) the cloud to develop and host AI software applications? How is the company positioned in the data value chain, and how should that influence short-term vs long-term infrastructure? How well is the company prepared to capitalize on forthcoming advances in AI hardware and data storage innovations? How will the company use new AI capabilities without causing IT and data inefficiencies?
