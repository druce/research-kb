**RAG with Multi-Tool Orchestration Overview**
This cookbook demonstrates building dynamic, multi-tool workflows using OpenAI's Responses API, implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to intelligently route user queries to appropriate tools. — [Shikhar Kwatra, OpenAI Cookbook]
---
**Responses API Flexibility**
The Responses API allows connection to both internal (file_search) and external vector databases (like Pinecone), enabling a versatile RAG solution. — [Shikhar Kwatra, OpenAI Cookbook]
---
**Dataset Preparation for RAG**
A sample medical reasoning dataset from Hugging Face is used, with "Question" and "Response" columns merged into a single string for embedding and metadata storage. — [Shikhar Kwatra, OpenAI Cookbook]
---
**Embedding Dimension Determination**
The embedding dimensionality is determined by computing an embedding from the merged question/answer text in the dataset. In this example, the embedding dimension is 1536 using the "text-embedding-3-small" model. — [Shikhar Kwatra, OpenAI Cookbook]
---
**Pinecone Index Creation**
The cookbook details creating a Pinecone index using the determined embedding dimension and upserting the prepared dataset into the index for semantic search. — [Shikhar Kwatra, OpenAI Cookbook]
---
**Querying the Pinecone Index**
A natural language query is embedded, and a similarity search is performed on the Pinecone index, returning results with metadata for context. — [Shikhar Kwatra, OpenAI Cookbook]
---
**Generating Responses with Retrieved Context**
The OpenAI Responses API is used to generate a final answer by combining the retrieved context from Pinecone with the original question. — [Shikhar Kwatra, OpenAI Cookbook]
---
**Available Tools for Orchestration**
The Responses API offers built-in functions like a web search preview tool and a Pinecone search tool for retrieving relevant documents. — [Shikhar Kwatra, OpenAI Cookbook]
---
**Web Search Preview Tool**
This tool enables the model to perform live web searches and preview results, ideal for retrieving real-time or up-to-date information. — [Shikhar Kwatra, OpenAI Cookbook]
---
**Pinecone Search Tool**
This tool allows the model to query a vector database using semantic search, useful for retrieving domain-specific content stored in a vectorized format. — [Shikhar Kwatra, OpenAI Cookbook]
---
**Dynamic Query Processing**
The system processes each query dynamically, calling the Responses API with tools enabled and allowing parallel tool calls. — [Shikhar Kwatra, OpenAI Cookbook]
---
**Tool Call Handling**
The system determines if a tool call is needed based on the initial response and processes it accordingly, invoking either the Pinecone search or a simulated web search. — [Shikhar Kwatra, OpenAI Cookbook]
---
**Appending Tool Output to Conversation**
The tool call and its output are appended back into the conversation to generate a final answer incorporating the tool's result. — [Shikhar Kwatra, OpenAI Cookbook]
---
**Sequential Tool Calling**
The cookbook demonstrates how multiple tool calls can be sequentially combined to generate a final response based on instructions provided to the Responses API. — [Shikhar Kwatra, OpenAI Cookbook]
---
**Example of Tool Selection**
The model selects the appropriate tool based on the input query: general questions may be handled by web search, while specific medical inquiries are addressed by retrieving context from Pinecone. — [Shikhar Kwatra, OpenAI Cookbook]
