**Key Finding: Shift from Human Data to Experiential Learning**
AI is transitioning from relying on human-generated data to learning from its own experiences, which will unlock superhuman capabilities. The pace of progress driven solely by supervised learning from human data is slowing, signaling the need for a new approach.

**Supporting Fact: AlphaProof's Success in Mathematics**
AlphaProof achieved a medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad by generating a hundred million proofs through continual interaction with a formal proving system, surpassing human-centric approaches.

**Key Quote: DeepSeek AI on Reinforcement Learning**
"Rather than explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the right incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-solving strategies." â€” DeepSeek AI

**Critical Capability: Long-Term Streams of Experience**
Buy-side firms need to develop AI agents that can operate within long-term streams of experience, adapting and learning continuously over time, rather than focusing on short, isolated interactions. This requires infrastructure to track and analyze data over extended periods.

---

**Critical Capability: Grounded Actions and Observations**
AI agents should interact with the real world through motor control, sensors, and digital interfaces, not just human dialogue. This includes using APIs, executing code, and interacting with computer interfaces.

---

**Critical Capability: Grounded Rewards**
Buy-side firms should move away from relying solely on human prejudgment for rewards and instead use grounded rewards based on real-world signals and consequences, such as market performance metrics or client satisfaction scores.

---

**Measuring Success: Impact of Grounded Rewards**
Success can be measured by the agent's ability to discover strategies that humans might not appreciate, leading to better performance and insights.

---

**Decision: Flexible Reward Adaptation**
Implement reward functions that can be flexibly adapted based on grounded signals and user feedback, allowing for continuous improvement and alignment with user goals.

---

**Critical Capability: Planning and Reasoning Beyond Human Terms**
Buy-side firms should explore AI systems that can plan and reason using non-human languages and methods, such as symbolic or differentiable computations, to overcome the limitations of human thought processes.

---

**Critical Capability: World Modeling**
Develop world models that predict the consequences of the agent's actions on the world, including predicting rewards. This allows the agent to plan directly in terms of its own actions and their causal effect upon the world.

---

**AI Roadmap: Reconciling Simulation and Generality**
The roadmap involves reconciling the ability of RL agents to self-discover knowledge (as seen in AlphaZero) with the task-generality achieved in the era of human data.

---

**Reinforcement Learning Methods: Revisit and Improve Classic RL Concepts**
The era of experience presents an opportunity to revisit and improve classic RL concepts, such as value functions, exploration techniques, and world models.

---

**Consequences: Acceleration of Scientific Discovery**
AI agents will autonomously design and conduct experiments in fields like materials science, medicine, or hardware design. By continuously learning from the results of their own experiments, these agents could rapidly explore new frontiers of knowledge, leading to the development of novel materials, drugs, and technologies at an unprecedented pace.

---

**Consequences: Safety Benefits of Experiential Learning**
Experiential agents can adapt to changes in their environment and correct misaligned reward functions over time, potentially mitigating safety risks associated with fixed AI systems.

---

**AI Roadmap: Continuous Adaptation and Goal Correction**
The roadmap includes mechanisms for continuous adaptation to environmental changes and incremental correction of misaligned reward functions based on human feedback.

**Key Finding: Experiential Data Will Eclipse Human Data**
Ultimately, experiential data will eclipse the scale and quality of human-generated data, leading to new capabilities that surpass those possessed by any human.
