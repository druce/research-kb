**Generative AI's Shift to "Act Two"**
The generative AI market is transitioning from "Act 1," focused on novel technology demonstrations, to "Act 2," which centers on solving human problems end-to-end with comprehensive solutions.

---

**Key Finding: Generative AI's Value Problem**
Despite high demand and numerous use cases, generative AI struggles to prove its value, evidenced by lackluster user retention and engagement compared to established companies.

---

**Supporting Fact: Low User Engagement in Generative AI Apps**
Generative AI applications have a median DAU/MAU of 14%, significantly lower than successful consumer companies like WhatsApp (85%), indicating users aren't finding enough daily value.

---

**Key Quote: The $200B Question**
"The $200B question is: What are you going to use all this infrastructure to do? How is it going to change people’s lives?" — David Cahn

---

**Critical Capability: Improving Model Performance**
Companies are using prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and dataset curation to improve the quality and usefulness of their AI products.

---

**Critical Capability: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
RAG is crucial for bringing in context about the business or the user, reducing hallucinations, and increasing the truthfulness and usefulness of AI outputs. Vector databases are the infrastructure backbone for RAG.

---

**Critical Capability: Evolving User Interfaces**
Generative AI interfaces are evolving beyond text-based conversations to include generative UIs and new modalities like human-sounding voices.

---

**Critical Capability: New Editing Experiences**
Generative AI is enabling new editing experiences, moving beyond zero-shot approaches to "ask-and-adjust" workflows with innovative controls.

---

**Critical Capability: Developing Agentic Systems**
Generative AI applications are progressing towards more autonomous systems that can problem-solve, access external tools, and solve problems end-to-end.

---

**Critical Capability: System-Wide Optimization**
Some companies are focusing on system-wide optimization by autonomously solving support tickets or pull requests, making the entire system more effective.

---

**AI Roadmap: From Demos to Whole Product Experiences**
The AI roadmap involves transforming flashy demos into comprehensive product experiences that deliver real value to users.

---

**Best Practice: Focus on Value and Whole Product Experiences**
Companies should prioritize building AI solutions that address the "value problem" and provide complete, user-friendly experiences.

---

**Key Finding: Data Moats are Shaky**
Data generated by application companies does not necessarily create an insurmountable moat, as future foundation models may diminish the value of that data. Workflows and user networks are more durable sources of competitive advantage.

---

**Supporting Fact: Generative AI Startup Revenue**
Generative AI has had a successful start, with startups alone generating >$1 billion in revenue, a milestone that took the SaaS market years to reach.

---

**Decision: Vertical Integration vs. Separation**
While a separation between application layer companies and foundation model providers was anticipated, the most successful early applications have been vertically integrated.

---

**Key Finding: Bottleneck on GPU Supply**
End user demand has outstripped GPU supply, creating a bottleneck for many companies' growth.

---

**Key Finding: Swift Incumbent Response**
Incumbents like Google and Adobe have responded quickly to the rise of generative AI, increasing competition in the market.
