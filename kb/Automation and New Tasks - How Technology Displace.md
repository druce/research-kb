**Automation Can Reduce Labor Demand**
Automation technologies can reduce labor demand if the displacement effect (labor being replaced by capital) outweighs the productivity effect (increased output). This is especially true for "so-so technologies" with marginal productivity gains. — Acemoglu and Restrepo

---

**Key Finding: Deceleration of Labor Demand Growth**
The US has experienced a slowdown in labor demand growth over the last three decades, with near-stagnation in the last two, due to weaker productivity growth and shifts in the task content of production against labor. — Acemoglu and Restrepo

---

**Reinstatement Effect Counterbalances Automation**
Historically, the displacement effect of automation has been counterbalanced by technologies that create new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage, leading to a "reinstatement effect" that increases labor demand. — Acemoglu and Restrepo

---

**Task Content of Production**
The "task content of production" refers to the allocation of tasks to capital or labor. Shifts in this allocation can significantly impact labor demand and productivity. — Acemoglu and Restrepo

---

**Automation's Impact on Labor Share**
Automation always reduces the labor share in industry value added, regardless of the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. — Acemoglu and Restrepo

---

**New Tasks Increase Labor Share**
The introduction of new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage always increases the labor share. — Acemoglu and Restrepo

---

**Productivity Effect of Automation Depends on Wages**
The productivity effect of automation is stronger when wages are high and labor is scarce, as the cost savings from substituting capital for labor are greater. — Acemoglu and Restrepo

---

**Factor-Augmenting Technologies vs. Automation/New Tasks**
Factor-augmenting technologies (making labor or capital more productive in existing tasks) primarily affect labor demand through the productivity effect, while automation and new tasks also have significant displacement and reinstatement effects. — Acemoglu and Restrepo

---

**Composition Effect in Multi-Sector Economy**
In a multi-sector economy, automation in one sector can reallocate economic activity to other sectors, creating a "composition effect" that impacts aggregate labor demand depending on the labor intensity of the expanding and contracting sectors. — Acemoglu and Restrepo

---

**Decomposition of Wage Bill Changes**
Changes in the aggregate wage bill can be decomposed into productivity, composition, substitution, and task content effects, allowing for analysis of the drivers of labor demand. — Acemoglu and Restrepo

---

**US Labor Demand Since WWII: 1947-1987**
From 1947 to 1987, rapid wage bill growth was largely driven by productivity gains, with small substitution and composition effects. Displacement and reinstatement effects were substantial but balanced each other out. — Acemoglu and Restrepo

---

**US Labor Demand Since WWII: 1987-2017**
From 1987 to 2017, labor demand growth slowed significantly due to weaker productivity growth and a negative shift in the task content of production against labor, driven by accelerated automation and decelerating reinstatement. — Acemoglu and Restrepo

---

**Evidence for Automation and New Task Measures**
Industry-level measures of automation technologies (e.g., robot penetration, share of routine jobs) are negatively correlated with changes in the task content of production in favor of labor, while measures of new tasks (e.g., share of new job titles) are positively correlated. — Acemoglu and Restrepo

---

**Policy Implications: Addressing Imbalances**
If the balance between automation and new tasks has shifted inefficiently, policy interventions may be needed to remove incentives for excessive automation and rebalance the direction of technological change. — Acemoglu and Restrepo

---

**Future of Work Depends on Task Creation**
The future of work depends on the creation of new tasks and other technologies that raise the labor intensity of production and the labor share, ensuring continued wage growth commensurate with productivity growth. — Acemoglu and Restrepo
