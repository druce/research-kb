Okay, I've analyzed the provided NBER working paper and extracted the following notes. These are formatted for use as individual index cards.

**Key Finding: Generative AI Boosts Productivity**
Access to a generative AI-based conversational assistant increased customer support agents' productivity by 14% on average, measured by issues resolved per hour. — Brynjolfsson et al. 2023

---

**Supporting Fact: AI Impact Greatest on Novice Workers**
The productivity gains from AI assistance were most significant for novice and low-skilled workers, with minimal impact on experienced and highly skilled agents. — Brynjolfsson et al. 2023

---

**Key Finding: AI Disseminates Tacit Knowledge**
The AI model appears to disseminate the tacit knowledge of more able workers, helping newer workers move down the experience curve faster. — Brynjolfsson et al. 2023

---

**Supporting Fact: AI Improves Customer Sentiment**
AI assistance improved customer sentiment in chat interactions, as measured by sentiment analysis of customer messages. — Brynjolfsson et al. 2023

---

**Supporting Fact: AI Reduces Managerial Intervention**
The use of AI assistance reduced the number of requests for managerial intervention from customers. — Brynjolfsson et al. 2023

---

**Supporting Fact: AI Improves Employee Retention**
AI assistance was associated with improved employee retention, particularly for newer workers. — Brynjolfsson et al. 2023

---

**Critical Capability: Augment, Don't Replace**
The AI system studied is designed to augment human agents, not replace them. Agents retain full discretion over whether to incorporate AI suggestions. This is key to the success of the implementation.

---

**Key Finding: AI Reduces Average Handle Time**
AI assistance leads to a 3.8 minute decrease in the average duration of customer chats, a 9% decline from the baseline mean. — Brynjolfsson et al. 2023

---

**Key Finding: AI Increases Chats Per Hour**
AI assistance leads to a 0.37 unit increase in the number of chats that an agent can handle per hour, a roughly 14% increase. — Brynjolfsson et al. 2023

---

**Key Finding: AI Increases Resolution Rate**
AI assistance leads to a small 1.3 percentage point increase in chat resolution rates. — Brynjolfsson et al. 2023

---

**Key Finding: AI Doesn't Impact Customer Satisfaction**
AI assistance doesn't lead to any economically significant change in customer satisfaction, as measured by net promoter scores. — Brynjolfsson et al. 2023

---

**Key Finding: AI Adherence Matters**
Returns to AI model deployment tend to be higher among agents who follow a greater share of recommendations. — Brynjolfsson et al. 2023

---

**Key Finding: AI Changes Communication Patterns**
AI assistance leads lower-skill agents to communicate more like high-skill agents. — Brynjolfsson et al. 2023

---

**Measuring Success: Resolutions Per Hour (RPH)**
Resolutions per hour (RPH), the number of chats that a worker is able to successfully resolve per hour, is the most effective summary of a worker’s productivity at the firm.

---

**Measuring Success: Average Handle Time (AHT)**
Average handle time (AHT), the average length of time an agent takes to finish a chat, is a key metric for measuring efficiency.

---

**Measuring Success: Resolution Rate (RR)**
Resolution rate (RR), the share of conversations that the agent can successfully resolve, is a key metric for measuring effectiveness.

---

**Measuring Success: Net Promoter Score (NPS)**
Net promoter score (NPS), customer satisfaction, is calculated by randomly surveying customers after a chat and calculating the percentage of customers who would recommend an agent minus the percentage who would not.
