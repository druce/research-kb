**Key Finding: Generative AI Boosts Developer Productivity**
The study found a 26.08% increase in completed tasks among software developers using GitHub Copilot across three field experiments.

---

**Supporting Fact: Experiment Sample Size**
The analysis included data from 4,867 software developers across Microsoft, Accenture, and an anonymous Fortune 100 electronics manufacturing company.

---

**Key Finding: Impact on Less Experienced Developers**
Less experienced and more junior developers showed higher adoption rates and greater productivity gains from using GitHub Copilot.

---

**Supporting Fact: Increased Code Updates and Compilations**
Usage of the coding assistant caused a 13.55% increase in code updates (commits) and a 38.38% increase in code compilations.

---

**Key Quote: Real-World vs. Lab Settings**
"While lab experiments offer a valuable opportunity to examine the short-term implications of generative AI, challenges and complex interactions arise when these tools are deployed in real-world environments."

---

**Critical Consideration: Adoption Rates Below 100%**
Despite the ease of adopting Copilot, adoption rates remained significantly below 100% in all three experiments, suggesting individual preferences and perceived utility play a role.

---

**Empirical Strategy: Addressing Imperfect Compliance**
The study uses experimental assignment as an instrument for adoption of GitHub Copilot to account for imperfect compliance.

---

**Empirical Strategy: Weighting for Instrument Relevance**
To address the issue of control groups gaining access to Copilot, the 2SLS estimates are weighted by the period-by-period difference in adoption across treatment and control groups.

---

**Heterogeneity: Adoption by Tenure and Level**
Short-tenure developers were 9.5 percentage points more likely to adopt Copilot, and junior developers were 5.3 percentage points more likely to adopt.

---

**Heterogeneity: Usage After Adoption**
Employees of shorter tenure are more likely to continue using Copilot more than one month after initial adoption.

---

**Heterogeneity: Code Acceptance Rates**
Higher-tenure developers are approximately 4.3% less likely to accept code suggested by Copilot.

---

**Heterogeneity: Productivity Gains by Tenure and Level**
The productivity-enhancing effects of Copilot are stronger for lower tenure and more junior developers.
