**Key Finding: Gen AI Paradox**
Nearly eight in ten companies report using gen AI, yet just as many report no significant bottom-line impact. This is referred to as the "gen AI paradox." — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Supporting Fact: Gen AI Adoption vs. Impact**
More than 78% of companies are using gen AI in at least one business function, but over 80% report no material contribution to earnings from these initiatives. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Key Finding: Imbalance of AI Use Cases**
The gen AI paradox stems from an imbalance between widely deployed "horizontal" (enterprise-wide) copilots with diffuse gains and transformative "vertical" (function-specific) use cases stuck in pilot mode. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Supporting Fact: Vertical Use Case Deployment**
Fewer than 10% of function-specific (vertical) gen AI use cases ever make it past the pilot stage. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Key Finding: AI Agents as a Solution**
AI agents offer a way to break out of the gen AI paradox by automating complex business processes and shifting gen AI from a reactive tool to a proactive, goal-driven virtual collaborator. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Key Capability: Process Reinvention**
Unlocking the full potential of agentic AI requires reimagining workflows from the ground up, with agents at the core, rather than simply plugging agents into existing processes. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Critical Capability: Agentic AI Mesh Architecture**
A new AI architecture paradigm—the agentic AI mesh—is needed to govern the evolving AI landscape, blend custom and off-the-shelf agents, and manage technical debt and risks. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Critical Challenge: Human Trust and Governance**
The biggest challenge in scaling agentic AI won't be technical, but human: earning trust, driving adoption, and establishing the right governance to manage agent autonomy and prevent uncontrolled sprawl. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Key Recommendation: Strategic AI Programs**
To scale impact, organizations must shift from scattered AI initiatives to strategic programs, aligning AI with critical strategic priorities. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Key Recommendation: Focus on Business Processes**
AI initiatives should focus on transforming entire business processes by embedding agents throughout the value chain, rather than optimizing isolated tasks. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Key Recommendation: Cross-Functional Transformation Squads**
Organizations must shift to a cross-functional delivery model, anchored in durable transformation squads composed of business domain experts, AI engineers, IT architects, and data engineers. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Key Recommendation: Industrialized, Scalable Delivery**
Organizations must shift to an industrialized delivery model, in which solutions are designed from the outset to scale, both technically and financially. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Critical Capability: Workforce Upskilling**
Organizations need to upskill the workforce, adapt the technology infrastructure, accelerate data productization, and deploy agent-specific governance mechanisms to effectively operate in the agentic era. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**CEO Mandate: End Experimentation Phase**
The time has come to bring the gen AI experimentation phase to a close, a pivot that only the CEO can make. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Decision: Custom vs. Off-the-Shelf Agents**
Realizing the full potential of agentic AI will require the development of custom-built agents for high-impact processes, as off-the-shelf agents may only streamline routine workflows. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Critical Capability: Managing AI Risks**
Organizations must manage the new wave of risks that AI agents bring, including uncontrolled autonomy, fragmented system access, and lack of observability. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Critical Capability: Agent and Workflow Discovery**
Agent and workflow discovery maintains a dynamic catalog of all organizational agents and workflows, enabling reuse across teams and enforcing policies on agent use. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Critical Capability: AI Asset Registry**
AI asset registry centralizes governance of system prompts, agent instructions, LLM configurations, tool definitions, and golden records while creating policies about version control and access. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Critical Capability: Observability**
Observability provides end-to-end tracing of workflows spanning agentic and procedural systems through standardized metrics, audit logs, and diagnostic capabilities. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Critical Capability: Authentication and Authorization**
Authentication and authorization enforce fine-grain access controls for communication among agentic systems, procedural systems, and LLMs, enforcing security policies and limiting the "blast radius" of compromised systems or agents. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Critical Capability: Evaluations**
Evaluations deliver comprehensive testing of agent pipelines to ensure accuracy and compliance over time. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Critical Capability: Feedback Management**
Feedback management enables continuous improvement through automated feedback loops that capture performance metrics to evolve agent configurations. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Critical Capability: Compliance and Risk Management**
Compliance and risk management embed policy controls, compliance agents, and ethical guardrails to ensure workflows meet regulatory and institutional standards. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Best Practice: Human-Agent Cohabitation**
Agents won't just assist humans—they'll act alongside them. Building clarity around these roles will take time, experimentation, and cultural adjustment. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Best Practice: Autonomy Control**
The challenge is not to eliminate autonomy but to make it intelligible and aligned with organizational expectations. Control mechanisms must also address the risk of hallucinations. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**Best Practice: Sprawl Containment**
Organizations must avoid agent sprawl through structured governance, design standards, and life cycle management. — McKinsey, June 2025

---

**AI Roadmap: Three Key Actions for CEOs**
1. Conclude the experimentation phase and realign AI priorities. 2. Redesign the AI governance and operating model. 3. Launch a first lighthouse transformation project and simultaneously initialize the agentic AI tech foundation. — McKinsey, June 2025
