**Key Finding: AI Investments Shift Workforce Composition**
Firms investing in AI technologies experience significant changes in workforce composition and organization, including shifts towards more educated workforces and flatter hierarchical structures.

---

**Key Finding: Upskilling Trend with AI Adoption**
AI investments are associated with a general upskilling trend, with firms increasing their shares of workers with bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees.

---

**Key Finding: Demand for Technical Skills Increases with AI**
AI investments are associated with a significant increase in the share of employees with STEM degrees and a corresponding decline in social science degrees.

---

**Key Finding: AI Investments Flatten Hierarchies**
AI investments are associated with firms becoming flatter, with higher shares of employees in entry-level roles and fewer in middle-management or senior roles.

---

**Supporting Fact: Magnitude of Hierarchy Flattening**
A one-standard-deviation change in the share of AI workers is associated with a 1.6% increase in the share of junior employees, a 0.8% decline in middle management, and a 0.7% decline in senior management.

---

**Supporting Fact: Education Increase with AI**
A one-standard-deviation increase in the firm's share of AI workers translates into a 3.7% increase in workers with associate's or bachelor's degrees, a 2.9% increase in master's degrees, and a 0.6% increase in doctoral degrees.

---

**Supporting Fact: Decline in Non-College Educated Workers**
The increases in educated workers correspond to a 7.2% decline in the share of workers without a college education.

---

**Supporting Fact: AI Investments Increase Required Education**
A one-standard-deviation increase in the share of AI workers is associated with a 0.5 additional year of required education in the firm's new job openings.

---

**Supporting Fact: Industry Coverage of Cognism Data**
The Cognism resume data captures 42% of all U.S. employment in 2010, increasing to 63% in 2018, with an average coverage of 53% across these years.

---

**Supporting Fact: Public Firms in Cognism Data**
The sample of 120 million person-firm-years matched to U.S. public firms corresponds to 19 million distinct individual employees.

---

**Critical Capability: Measuring Firm-Level AI Investments**
Accurately measuring firm-level AI investments is crucial for understanding the impact of AI on workforce composition. The study uses a novel measure based on firms' AI-skilled human capital.

---

**Critical Capability: Granular Data on Labor Composition**
Access to granular data on firms' labor composition and organization, including educational backgrounds and hierarchical positions, is essential for in-depth empirical analysis.

---

**Decisions: Excluding Tech Sector Firms**
The study excludes firms in the tech sectors (2-digit NAICS 51 or 54) to focus on the impact of AI on AI-using firms rather than AI-producing firms.

---

**AI Roadmap: Gradual Accumulation of AI Investments**
AI investments accumulate gradually over time and generate effects that are not immediate, making a long-differences strategy well-suited for analysis.

---

**Best Practice: Long-Differences Regression**
Using long-differences regressions (changes from 2010 to 2018) helps ensure that time-invariant firm characteristics do not drive the results.

---

**Measuring Success: Metrics for AI Programs**
Success can be measured by the changes in workforce composition, such as the increase in STEM workers or the flattening of the hierarchy, associated with AI investments.

**Key Quote: AI as Prediction Technology**
"AI is a prediction technology, and predictions are at the heart of decision-making under uncertainty...making AI applicable to solve a variety of business problems with different potential effects on labor." — [Babina, Fedyk, He, and Hodson]

---

**Key Quote: AI and Upskilling**
"While Babina et al. (2021) show that AI investments increase total firm employment, our evidence further shows that this increase is concentrated in highly-educated workers and high-skill workers with STEM backgrounds and IT skills." — [Babina, Fedyk, He, and Hodson]

---

**Key Quote: AI and Organizational Structure**
"We find that firms investing in AI technologies become less top-heavy, which is similar to the previously-documented effect of IT but opposite to the effect of communication technologies." — [Babina, Fedyk, He, and Hodson]
