Established firms spent between $18 and $27 billion on internal corporate investment in AI-related projects in 2016. — Furman and Seamans, McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) report

---

**Supporting Fact: Venture Capital in AI Startups**
Venture capital investment in AI startups grew by 40% between 2013 and 2016, showing increasing investor confidence in AI ventures. — Furman and Seamans, MGI report

---

**Supporting Fact: Robot Shipments Increase**
Worldwide robot shipments increased about 150% between 2010 and 2016, reflecting growing adoption of robotics in various industries. — Furman and Seamans, International Federation of Robotics (IFR)

---

**Supporting Fact: Robot Price Decrease**
Robot prices decreased 50-80% between 1990 and 2005, contributing to increased adoption. — Furman and Seamans, Graetz and Michaels (2015)

---

**Supporting Fact: Automotive Sector Robot Density**
In the US automotive sector, there were approximately 1,091 robots per 10,000 workers in 2012, highlighting the high adoption rate in this industry. — Furman and Seamans, Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) 2016

---

**Supporting Fact: AI Patent Applications Surge**
Patent applications with the term "artificial intelligence" in its abstract have roughly doubled between 2002-2015 and 2016-2017. — Furman and Seamans, USPTO

---

**Key Finding: AI as a General Purpose Technology (GPT)**
AI and other advanced automation can be considered a general-purpose technology (GPT) that enables follow-on innovation and productivity growth. — Furman and Seamans

---

**Key Finding: Robotics and GDP Growth**
Robotics added an estimated 0.4 percentage points of annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth between 1993 and 2007, on average, for the 17 countries in their sample. — Furman and Seamans, Graetz and Michaels (2015)

---

**Key Finding: AI's Impact on Labor Markets**
AI has been too small a component of the overall economy to have a significant impact on labor markets to date, but this is expected to change. — Furman and Seamans

---

**Key Finding: Innovation's Effects on Labor**
Innovation has four effects on labor markets: displacement, job creation, increased demand, and task replacement. — Furman and Seamans

---

**Key Finding: AI and Inequality**
To the degree that AI does not displace labor, part of that will be because relative wages adjust, in other words, that inequality rises. — Furman and Seamans

---

**Key Finding: Digital Economy and Market Concentration**
Internet markets have tended to favor large digital platforms that hold high market shares, a characteristic that is traditionally associated with low competition in brick-and-mortar markets. — Furman and Seamans

---

**Critical Consideration: Algorithmic Pricing Opacity**
The use of increasingly complex algorithms for setting prices can lead to undesirable price behavior, sometimes even unintentionally. — Furman and Seamans

---

**Critical Consideration: Data as a Barrier to Entry**
Large data sets are a critical input for firms that want to create or use AI systems, potentially creating a barrier to entry for startups. — Furman and Seamans

---

**Decision: Data Portability**
Data portability allows customers to take their data from one provider to another, potentially increasing competition. — Furman and Seamans

---
