**GitHub Copilot Increases Developer Productivity**
A controlled experiment showed that developers using GitHub Copilot completed a programming task 55.8% faster than those without access. — [Peng et al.]

---

**Supporting Fact: Completion Time Reduction**
The treatment group (with Copilot) averaged 71.17 minutes to complete the task, compared to 160.89 minutes for the control group. — [Peng et al.]

---

**Key Finding: Heterogeneous Benefits**
Less experienced developers, those who code more hours per day, and developers aged 25-44 benefited the most from using GitHub Copilot. — [Peng et al.]

---

**Supporting Fact: Statistical Significance**
The 55.8% reduction in completion time was statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.0017 and a 95% confidence interval of [21%, 89%]. — [Peng et al.]

---

**Study Design: Controlled Experiment**
The study involved 95 professional programmers recruited through Upwork, randomly assigned to control and treatment groups. — [Peng et al.]

---

**Methodology: Task and Metrics**
Participants were tasked with implementing an HTTP server in JavaScript, and performance was measured by task success and task completion time. — [Peng et al.]

---

**Measuring Success: Task Completion and Success Rate**
Task completion time was measured from the start to the first successful completion of all 12 tests in the test suite. — [Peng et al.]

---

**Key Capability: Experimentation and Measurement**
Buy-side firms should design controlled experiments to measure the impact of AI tools on specific tasks and workflows.

---

**Supporting Fact: Willingness to Pay**
The treated group (with Copilot) had a significantly higher average "irrelevant price" (willingness to pay) for GitHub Copilot ($27.25/month) compared to the control group ($16.91/month). — [Peng et al.]

---

**Key Finding: Self-Reported vs. Actual Productivity Gain**
Participants underestimated the productivity gain from Copilot, self-reporting an average of 35% increase compared to the actual 55.8% reduction in completion time. — [Peng et al.]

---

**Critical Consideration: Code Quality**
The study did not examine the effects of AI on code quality, which is an important factor for performance and security. — [Peng et al.]

---

**AI Roadmap: Start with Standardized Tasks**
Begin by evaluating AI tools on standardized programming tasks to obtain precise measures of productivity before applying them to larger, more complex projects.

---

**Measuring Success: Monitor Code Quality**
In addition to productivity metrics, track code quality metrics such as bug rates, security vulnerabilities, and code maintainability.

---

**Key Quote: Economic Impact**
"If the results of this study were to be extrapolated to the population level, a 55.8% increase in productivity would imply a significant amount of cost savings in the economy and have a notable impact on GDP growth." — [Peng et al.]

---

**Critical Consideration: Labor Market Implications**
Further research is needed to understand how AI-powered developer tools will impact the labor market, including changes in job tasks and skill requirements. — [Peng et al.]
