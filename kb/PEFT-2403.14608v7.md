**Key Finding: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is a Practical Solution for Customizing Large Models**
PEFT efficiently adjusts large models for specific tasks, minimizing the introduction of new parameters and computational resources. This is crucial for large language models (LLMs) with high parameter counts, where full fine-tuning is computationally expensive.

---

**Key Finding: PEFT Techniques are Applicable Across Diverse Model Architectures and Tasks**
PEFT's versatility extends beyond NLP, finding applications in computer vision (Vision Transformers, diffusion models) and vision-language models, underscoring its broad applicability.

---

**Key Finding: PEFT Methods Can Be Categorized into Additive, Selective, Reparameterized, and Hybrid Approaches**
These categories differ in how they modify the model architecture, tune existing parameters, or combine different PEFT techniques.

**Supporting Fact: LLaMA Architecture Consists of Three Major Components**
LLaMA consists of an embedding block, a stack of decoder blocks (MSA and FFN), and a head block (linear and softmax layer). — Section II-A

---

**Supporting Fact: Standard Full Fine-Tuning is Highly Inefficient for Large Models**
Full fine-tuning of LLMs requires thousands of GPUs working in parallel, which is highly inefficient and unsustainable. PEFT aims to tune minimal parameters to achieve better performance.

**Key Quote: "Fine-tuning remains essential to enhance LLM performance on unseen user datasets and tasks."**
This highlights the ongoing need for adaptation despite the generalization capabilities of large language models.

**Critical Capability: Efficient KV-Cache Management is Crucial for LLM Inference**
Storing previous Keys and Values in the Key-Value cache (KV-cache) accelerates the inference process in LLM models by avoiding recalculation for each new token.

---

**Critical Capability: Balancing Latency and Memory Usage is a Key System Design Challenge**
Efficient handling of numerous task-specific queries via centralized PEFT query servicing, resolving privacy and data transmission issues through distributed PEFT training, and the complexities associated with concurrent multi-PEFT training processes are key challenges.

---

**AI Roadmap: Stages of PEFT Implementation**
1. Register PEFT tasks through a standardized API.
2. Provide the Pre-Trained Model Tag, PEFT parameters in a compressed format, and the specific PEFT algorithms.
3. The inference engine takes charge of query processing. — PetS Framework

**Decisions: Selecting the Right PEFT Technique**
The choice of PEFT technique (Adapter, Soft Prompt, LoRA, etc.) depends on the specific task, model architecture, and available computational resources. Hybrid approaches can combine the strengths of different techniques.

---

**Best Practice: Consider Structured Pruning for Hardware Efficiency**
Structured masking organizes parameter masking in regular patterns, unlike unstructured ones that apply it randomly, thus enhancing computational and hardware efficiency during training.

---

**Measuring Success: Key Metrics for PEFT Serving Systems**
System throughput (tokens per second), memory footprint, accuracy performance (with varying context lengths), and quality of services (latency, deadline missing rates) are important metrics.

---

**Measuring Success: Key Metrics for PEFT Training Systems**
Accuracy performance of the fine-tuned model, compute cost during forward and backward propagation, and communication cost (data transfer between edge and cloud) are important metrics.

---

**AI Roadmap: Future Directions in PEFT Research**
Simplify hyperparameter tuning, establish a unified benchmark, enhance training efficiency, explore scaling laws, serve more models and tasks, enhance data privacy, and PEFT with model compression.
