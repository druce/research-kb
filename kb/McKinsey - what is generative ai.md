**Definition of Generative AI**
Generative AI algorithms, like ChatGPT, create new content such as audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos. — McKinsey Explainers, January 2023

---
**ChatGPT's Capabilities**
ChatGPT is a free chatbot developed by OpenAI that can generate answers to almost any question and is considered the best AI chatbot ever. — McKinsey Explainers, January 2023

---
**Rapid Adoption of ChatGPT**
ChatGPT gained over a million users in just five days after its public release in November 2022. — McKinsey Explainers, January 2023

---
**AI Adoption is Increasing**
A 2022 McKinsey survey shows that AI adoption has more than doubled over the past five years, and investment in AI is increasing. — McKinsey Explainers, January 2023

---
**AI vs. Machine Learning**
Artificial intelligence mimics human intelligence to perform tasks, while machine learning is a type of AI where models learn from data patterns without human direction. — McKinsey Explainers, January 2023

---
**Machine Learning's Potential**
The increasing volume and complexity of data have amplified the potential and necessity of machine learning. — McKinsey Explainers, January 2023

---
**Generative AI Breakthrough**
Generative AI goes beyond perceiving and classifying content; it can create new content on demand, like an image or text description of a cat. — McKinsey Explainers, January 2023

---
**Self-Supervised Learning in Text Models**
Next-generation text-based machine learning models use self-supervised learning, where they are fed massive amounts of text to generate predictions. — McKinsey Explainers, January 2023

---
**Resource Intensive Model Building**
Building generative AI models requires significant resources, including talent and vast amounts of data, making it accessible primarily to well-funded tech companies. — McKinsey Explainers, January 2023

---
**GPT-3 Training Data**
GPT-3 was trained on approximately 45 terabytes of text data, costing an estimated several million dollars. — McKinsey Explainers, January 2023

---
**Generative AI Outputs Vary in Quality**
Outputs from generative AI models can range from indistinguishable from human-generated content to uncanny, depending on the model's quality and the match between the model and the use case. — McKinsey Explainers, January 2023

---
**Generative AI for Content Creation**
Generative AI tools can produce credible writing in seconds and respond to criticism, benefiting industries needing clear written materials. — McKinsey Explainers, January 2023

---
**Generative AI for Technical Materials**
Generative AI can create technical materials, such as higher-resolution versions of medical images. — McKinsey Explainers, January 2023

---
**Options for AI Implementation**
Companies can either use generative AI "out of the box" or fine-tune them to perform specific tasks. — McKinsey Explainers, January 2023

---
**Risks of Generative AI**
Generative AI models may produce inaccurate, biased, or manipulated information, leading to reputational and legal risks. — McKinsey Explainers, January 2023

---
**Mitigating AI Risks**
Risks can be mitigated by carefully selecting training data, using smaller specialized models, customizing general models, keeping a human in the loop, and avoiding AI for critical decisions. — McKinsey Explainers, January 2023

---
**Importance of Staying Informed**
The landscape of risks and opportunities in generative AI is rapidly evolving, requiring leaders to stay informed about regulation and risk. — McKinsey Explainers, January 2023
