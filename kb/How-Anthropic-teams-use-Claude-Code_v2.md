**AI Adoption Transforming Workflows**
Anthropic's internal teams are using Claude Code to transform workflows, enabling both technical and non-technical staff to handle complex projects, automate tasks, and overcome skill gaps.

---

**Key Finding: Automation of Routine Tasks**
Claude Code is used across various departments to automate routine tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more strategic and complex work.

---

**Key Finding: Bridging Skill Gaps**
Teams with members lacking specific technical skills, such as machine learning or Javascript, are using Claude Code to bridge these gaps and contribute effectively.

---

**Critical Capability: Prompt Engineering**
The quality and detail of prompts significantly impact Claude Code's performance; clear and specific prompts lead to more reliable and independent work by the AI.

---

**Critical Capability: Iterative Development**
Teams find success by treating Claude Code as an iterative partner, working in small steps and frequently checking the AI's work, rather than expecting perfect solutions on the first try.

---

**Best Practice: Detailed Documentation**
Writing detailed Claude.md files documenting workflows, tools, and expectations improves Claude Code's performance, particularly for routine tasks.

---

**Best Practice: Custom Memory Files**
Creating custom memory files that provide Claude with specific instructions about the user's role and needs improves the quality and relevance of the AI's responses.

---

**Best Practice: Visual-First Approach**
Using screenshots to show Claude Code desired interfaces and iterating based on visual feedback can be more effective than describing features in text.

---

**AI Roadmap: Start with Code Generation**
Begin by giving Claude Code specific instructions to write logic and then verify its correctness to build trust in the tool's capabilities before using it for more complex tasks. — Inference Team

---

**AI Roadmap: Identify API-Enabled Repetitive Tasks**
Focus on workflows involving repetitive actions with tools that have APIs (e.g., ad platforms, design tools, analytics platforms) as prime candidates for automation with Claude Code. — Growth Marketing Team

---

**Measuring Success: Reduced Time-to-Resolution**
The Security Engineering team reduced incident resolution time by using Claude Code to trace control flow through the codebase, decreasing the time from 10-15 minutes to about 5 minutes.

---

**Measuring Success: Faster Feature Implementation**
The Product Development team successfully implemented complex features like Vim mode with 70% of the code written autonomously by Claude.

---

**Measuring Success: Increased Creative Output**
The Growth Marketing team achieved a 10x increase in creative output by using Claude Code to automate ad variation generation and integrate with Figma.

---

**Key Quote: "Large state management changes that you typically wouldn’t see a designer making"**
Engineers noted that designers are now making significant state management changes directly using Claude Code, enabling them to achieve their exact design vision. — Product Design Team

---

**Key Quote: "Holy crap, I’m a developer workflow"**
Non-technical users experience a "holy crap, I'm a developer workflow" when using Claude Code, gaining entirely new capabilities previously impossible. — Product Design Team

---

**Decision: Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Coding**
Product Development teams need to distinguish between tasks that work well asynchronously (peripheral features, prototyping) versus those needing synchronous supervision (core business logic, critical fixes).

---

**Decision: MCP Servers for Sensitive Data**
The Data Infrastructure team recommends using MCP servers rather than the BigQuery CLI to maintain better security control over what Claude Code can access, especially for sensitive data.

---

**Critical Capability: Security and Compliance Awareness**
Legal teams immediately identify security implications of deep MCP integrations, noting how conservative security postures will create barriers as AI tools access more sensitive systems.

---

**Best Practice: Share Team Usage Sessions**
The Data Infrastructure team held sessions where members demonstrated their Claude Code workflows to each other, helping spread best practices and showing different ways to use the tool.

---

**Best Practice: Treat it like a slot machine**
Save your state before letting Claude work, let it run for 30 minutes, then either accept the result or start fresh rather than trying to wrestle with corrections. Starting over often has a higher success rate than trying to fix Claude’s mistakes. — Data Science and ML Engineering teams
